# Summary

* contains statement of need
* introduction to package
* maybe quick example

section 1:
Intro, statement of need

HELP NEEDED: idea collection for statement of need
* Paragraph1: focus on need for spatial analysis?

* Paragraph2: focus on need to visualize spatial analysis?

* paragraph3: splot as solution, this is what we can do for different audiences

splot is a visual steering tool, facilitating human guidance in interpreting results and choosing between different statistical analysis methods.

* paragraph4: more technical description

Implemented in Python, splot extends both PySAL's analytics and matplotlib visualization functionality in visualising spatial analysis workflows and result presentation. It provides users quick access through a high level API to visualise popular PySAL objects. We hereby aim to implement a multilute of views for different spatial analysis workflows, to provide users the opportunity to view a problem from different angles. The splot package facilitates the creation of both static plots ready for publication and interactive visualisations for quick iteration and spatial data exploration. 

* paragraph 5: concluding sentence, what follows
