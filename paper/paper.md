# Summary

* contains statement of need
* introduction to package
* maybe quick example

Geography is an intensely-visual domain. Its longstanding dependence on visualisation and cartography show as much, with John Snowâ€™s cholera map serving as one of the first instances of scientific visualization in pursuit of data analysis [@johnson2007ghost,@Arribas-Bel2017], and the perennial presence of maps as statistical displays in seminal works on visualization [@tufte2001visual]. As such, the existence and continued focus on maps in geographical analysis demands serious, dedicated attention in scientific computing. However, existing methods in Python, specifically for *statistical* visualization of spatial data, are somewhat lacking. General-purpose mapping provided by `geopandas` is not fine-tuned enough for analytical/statistical analysis. The more analytically-oriented views offered by `geoplot`, while useful, are limited in their statistical applications. Thus, the need remains for a strong, analytically-oriented toolbox for geographical analysis.

This need is explicitly heightened by the fact that the collection and generation of geographical data is becoming more pervasive [@goodchild2007citizen,@arribas-bel2014accidental]. With the proliferation of high-accuracy GPS data, many datasets are now *becoming* spatial datasets; their analysis and visualization increasingly requires explicitly spatial methods that account for the various special structures in geographical data [@anselin1988spatial]. Geographical questions about dependence, endogeneity, heterogeneity, and non-stationarity often require special statistical tools to diagnose, and spatial analytic software to visualize [@anselin2014modern]. Further with the increasing importance of code and computation in geographical curricula [@rey2009show,@rey2018code,@ucgis2019geographic], it has become critical for both pedagogical and research reasons to support geographical analysis with robust visualization tools.  

HELP NEEDED: idea collection for statement of need
* paragraph3: splot as solution, this is what we can do for different audiences

It is this niche that `splot` is designed to fill. As a visual steering tool, `splot` facilitates analysis, interpretation of results, and makes the process of model selection easier and more clear. 

* paragraph4: more technical description

Implemented in Python, splot extends both PySAL's analytics and matplotlib visualization functionality in visualising spatial analysis workflows and result presentation. It provides users quick access through a high level API to visualise popular PySAL objects. We hereby aim to implement a multitude of views for different spatial analysis workflows, to provide users the opportunity to view a problem from different angles. The splot package facilitates the creation of both static plots ready for publication and interactive visualisations for quick iteration and spatial data exploration.
